Instructor's solution to Phase 2 of the 2020 course project,
a Scanner/Screener/Parser for the Qust programming language.

You can compare and update your own Phase 2 solution using this one as a reference 
if you find that your own Phase 2 is not working well enough for you to work on Phase 3.

Of course, correct solutions need not be identical; they can be very different 
and still meet the specifications. 

If you cannot get your own Phase 2 solution working well enough to do Phase 3, 
you can use this solution as the input to your Phase 3 if you ask for permission to do so.
